## About The Project

RePoll is a modern web application designed to gather instant, anonymous feedback from an audience. An admin can quickly create a poll, set a duration, and share a unique link. Anyone with the link can vote, and the results are displayed visually.


### Key Features

* **Admin Authentication:** Secure sign-up and sign-in system for poll creators.
* **Protected Admin Routes:** Middleware ensures that all admin pages are secure and require a valid login session.
* **Dynamic Poll Creation:** Admins can create polls with a variable number of options and a set duration.
* **Public Voting Pages:** Each poll has a unique, shareable URL for anonymous voting.
* **"Near Real-Time" Results:** The results page for voters automatically updates every 5 seconds
* **Visual Data Representation:** Poll results are displayed in a clean, easy-to-read bar chart using the Recharts library.
